# Category Theory
> There are only two things - Identity and Composition.

# Functional Programming - think in math function
 1. Pure function - means no side-effect.
 2. Keep every thing immutable - BUG like mutable variables and closjure is toxic.
 3. Functor - transfer one function applied to another category.
 4. Composite - Functions can be composite to be a bigger function.
 5. Curry - Partially applied function is almost another function.
 6. Thinking in recursive way - No loop, or no more loop.
